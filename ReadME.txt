<h1>DICE GAME</h1>

<p>
This is the dice game.
Just a little project that I did to practice the use of DOM.
I'm new to javaScript and DOM so I decided to do this just for fun. HOPE YOU LIKE IT!

HOW TO USE:
    > Just refresh the page to get results. 
    > Use this for fun, win arguments with this :D
